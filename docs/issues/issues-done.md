# DONE Issues

---

## [1] Setup initial workspace parsing
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `src/model/parse.rs`, `src/model/workspace.rs`

Build the core engine to read/write issues from markdown files. Needs to handle custom sections, parse metadata (Status, Files, Depends on), and cleanly separate the Description text from the Resolution text.

**Resolution:** Implemented a robust line-based parser and `Workspace::save` logic that correctly maps Issue structs back to properly formatted Markdown files.

## [2] Basic Dioxus desktop UI layout
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `src/ui/app.rs`, `src/ui/styles.rs`

Create the main shell, sidebar navigation, and a feed view. Ensure it matches a clean, dark-mode aesthetic with DM Sans and JetBrains Mono.

**Resolution:** Built the shell and injected CSS variables for consistent theming across the app.

## [3] Implement custom drag-and-drop physics
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `src/ui/views/physics.rs`, `src/ui/views/feed/card.rs`

Standard HTML5 drag-and-drop feels clunky. Write a custom spring physics engine (stiffness, damping, mass) to make the cards feel tactile, fluid, and fun to reorder.

**Resolution:** Implemented `DragState` with 60fps spring animations for rotation, scaling, and positional snapping. Feels incredibly smooth!

## [10] Support SQLite database backend
**Status:** DESCOPED
**Files:** `src/model/mod.rs`

Add support for storing issues in a local `issues.db` SQLite file for faster querying and relationship mapping.

**Resolution:** Descoped. Violates the core philosophy of Ishoo. The whole point is to keep issues as portable, human-readable markdown files that can be version-controlled natively with Git. A database is an anti-goal.
